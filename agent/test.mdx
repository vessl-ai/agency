## Overview

A template Run for creating and running your first model on VESSL AI simply by pinpointing to a GitHub repo and Hugging Face dataset.

## Description

This template run deploys an empty Python container on the cloud with custom Docker images and hardware requirements. Play around with the key-value pairs like `resources`, `import`, and `run` to scale from a GPU-accelerated Jupyter notebook to LLM fine-tuning in seconds.

## Quickstart

You can run the barebone containerized run with the following script.

```sh
vessl run create -f hub.yaml
```
